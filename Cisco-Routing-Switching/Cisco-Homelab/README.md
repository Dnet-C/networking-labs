# Cisco Networking Home Lab

## 📘 Overview
This repository documents my **Cisco networking home lab**, built to support my hands-on learning and preparation for the **Cisco CCNP Enterprise certification**. By configuring, testing, and troubleshooting real hardware, I aim to strengthen my skills in routing, switching, and network security—while gaining practical experience that mirrors enterprise environments.

## 🖥️ Lab Equipment
My home lab consists of:

- **Cisco ASA 5520** – Firewall for perimeter security and VPN configuration  
- **2 × Cisco 2911 ISR Routers** – For WAN routing, NAT, and dynamic routing protocols  
- **Cisco Catalyst 2960S Switch** – Layer 2 access switching, VLANs, trunking, and STP  
- **Cisco Catalyst 3560G Switch** – Layer 3 switching, inter-VLAN routing, and advanced switching features  

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary goal of this lab is to create an environment where I can:

- Practice and reinforce **CCNP Enterprise topics** such as:  
  - OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP  
  - VLANs, VTP, and STP  
  - Inter-VLAN routing and Layer 3 switching  
  - NAT, ACLs, and DHCP services  
  - VPNs and firewall policies on Cisco ASA  
- Gain hands-on troubleshooting experience with Cisco IOS and ASA CLI  
- Build, test, and document real-world networking scenarios  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `/configs` – Saved device configurations  
- `/diagrams` – Network topologies and lab diagrams  
- `/labs` – Step-by-step lab exercises and scenarios  
- `/notes` – Study notes and reference material for CCNP topics  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Expand the lab with **multi-site topologies**  
- Integrate with **virtualized labs (CML / GNS3 / EVE-NG)** for hybrid learning  
- Develop **automation playbooks (Ansible, Python)** to configure and manage devices  

## 🏁 Conclusion
This lab is a key part of my journey toward becoming a **Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP)**. By documenting each step, I not only reinforce my own learning but also share resources with others preparing for networking certifications.
